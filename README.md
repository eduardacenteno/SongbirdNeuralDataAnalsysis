## SongbirdNeuralDataAnalysis

This software was built with the aim of allowing the user to work with Spike2 .smr files and analysing neural and vocalization data collected from songbirds.       

Our group works with neuronal and vocal data collected from Zebra finches while they sing. Therefore, the parameters here might have to be ajusted to your own specific data.
